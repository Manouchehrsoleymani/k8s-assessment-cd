      # An AnalysisTemplate is referenced at the second step, which starts an AnalysisRun after
      # the setWeight step. The rollout will not progress to the following step until the
      # AnalysisRun is complete. A failure/error of the analysis will cause the rollout's update to
      # abort, and set the canary weight to zero.
